# notion-svc-profile-pipe

`notion-svc-profile-pipe` is a focused Kotlin codebase around design a Kotlin verification harness for profile systems, covering visual model generation, layout fixtures, and failure-oriented tests. It is meant to be easy to inspect, run, and extend without a hosted service.

## Notion Svc Profile Pipe Walkthrough

I would read the project from the outside in: command, fixture, model, then roadmap. That keeps the backend services idea grounded in files that can be checked locally.

## Capabilities

- Includes extended examples for queue pressure, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents bounded workers tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## Reason For The Project

The goal is to capture the core behavior in code and make the surrounding assumptions obvious. A reader should be able to run the verifier, open the fixtures, and understand why each decision was made.

## Where Things Live

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## How It Is Put Together

The project is organized around a compact model rather than a large framework. Inputs are scored, classified, and checked against golden fixtures. The constants live in code and are mirrored in metadata so documentation drift is easy to catch. The Kotlin version keeps data classes and model logic close together for a JVM-friendly core.

## Command Examples

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Data Notes

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `surge` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## Check The Work

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Tradeoffs

This code is local-first. It makes no claim about deployed usage and avoids credentials, hosted state, and environment-specific setup.

## Possible Extensions

- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Add one more backend services fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Getting It Running

Use a normal shell with Kotlin available on `PATH`. The verifier is written as a PowerShell script because the portfolio was assembled on Windows.
